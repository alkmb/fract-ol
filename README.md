# Fract-ol Project
- Overview:
The Fract-ol project is a visually captivating program that displays fractals, particularly focusing on the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. The project serves as an introduction to the Xlib library, offering graphical interfaces in C. The mathematical operations involved in working with real and imaginary numbers to create the fractal sets provide an immersive learning experience. The bonus features include color shifting options, cursor-following zoom, arrow movement, and the addition of a third fractal, the Tricorn.
